# How to execute locally

One time: npm install -g http-server

execute http-server from the directory which you want to host (http:127.0.0.1:8080)

if you dont use http-server and directly try to load with the file:/// method, it fails CORS error as below:

jquery-1.12.3.js:10261 XMLHttpRequest cannot load file:///Users/hrishikesh/C/GitHub/IR-WS/DSA/LinkedLists/removeElement_complex.js. Cross origin requests are only supported for protocol schemes: http, data, chrome, chrome-extension, https, chrome-extension-resource.
