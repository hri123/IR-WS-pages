subnet -

Subnet - is a range of IP addresses determined by part of an address (often called the network address) and a subnet mask (netmask). For example, if the netmask is 255.255.255.0 (or /24 for short), and the network address is 192.168.10.0, then that defines a range of IP addresses 192.168.10.0 through 192.168.10.255. Shorthand for writing that is 192.168.10.0/24. (http://superuser.com/questions/353664/what-is-the-difference-between-a-vlan-and-a-subnet)

switch -

A network switch (sometimes known as a switching hub) is acomputer networking device that is used to connect devices together on a computer network, by using a form of packet switching to forward data to the destination device.
(my guess - switch is connecting computers in the same subnet, different subnets, you need a router in addition to switch ?)


VLAN -

switch partitioning

Router -

Let's say a computer with an interface with an IP address of 192.168.10.4/24 wants to talk to a computer with an interface with an IP address of 192.168.20.4/24. Different subnets, so we must go through a router.

Gateway -

A "gateway" always means the IP address of a router.
